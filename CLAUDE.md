# GetLicense API — Project Conventions

## Quick Start

```bash
make run          # start Postgres + run migrations + start server (development mode)
make e2e          # drop+recreate getlicense_e2e DB only, then run hurl scenarios
make test         # unit tests (no DB required)
make test-all     # unit + integration tests (requires Postgres)
make db-reset     # NUKE EVERYTHING — drops the Postgres volume (dev + e2e). Use only when local state is corrupted.
```

### Database layout
The Postgres container hosts two databases on one volume:

- **`getlicense`** — dev data (products, licenses, accounts). Persisted across `make run` restarts; never touched by e2e.
- **`getlicense_e2e`** — scratch database used by `make e2e`. Dropped and recreated on every e2e run.

Running `make e2e` does NOT wipe your dev signup, products, or licenses anymore. If you need a truly fresh slate (corrupted migrations, etc.), `make db-reset` is the escape hatch.

## Architecture: Service/Repository Pattern

```
HTTP Request → Handler (parse, auth) → Service (business logic) → Repository (data access) → PostgreSQL
```

- **Handlers** (`server/handler/`) — thin HTTP adapters, 5-15 lines, no business logic
- **Services** (`auth/`, `product/`, `licensing/`, `webhook/`) — own all business logic, depend on repository interfaces
- **Repositories** (`db/`) — implement interfaces from `domain/`, all SQL via pgx

## Three-ID Request Model

Every authenticated request carries three distinct IDs on the `AuthContext`:

- **IdentityID** — global login identity (nil for API-key auth). One identity can belong to many accounts.
- **ActingAccountID** — the account the caller is authenticating as. Audit logs and rate limits key on this.
- **TargetAccountID** — the account whose data is being read/written. Equal to `ActingAccountID` on every standard route; mutated by the grant routing middleware on `/v1/grants/:id/...` routes so a grantee can manage licenses in the grantor's tenant.

Handlers that scope DB writes (e.g. `license.Create`) MUST use `auth.TargetAccountID`. Everything audit/billing-shaped uses `auth.ActingAccountID`.

## Data Flow

```go
// Handler: authorize + get auth, call service, return JSON
func (h *ProductHandler) Create(c fiber.Ctx) error {
    var req product.CreateRequest
    if err := c.Bind().Body(&req); err != nil { return err }
    auth, err := authz(c, rbac.ProductCreate)
    if err != nil { return err }
    result, err := h.svc.Create(c.Context(), auth.TargetAccountID, auth.Environment, req)
    if err != nil { return err }
    return c.Status(fiber.StatusCreated).JSON(result)
}

// Service: business logic, runs inside an RLS-scoped tx
func (s *Service) Create(ctx context.Context, accountID core.AccountID, env core.Environment, req CreateRequest) (*domain.Product, error) {
    var result *domain.Product
    err := s.txManager.WithTargetAccount(ctx, accountID, env, func(ctx context.Context) error {
        // ... business logic, repo calls within transaction
    })
    return result, err
}
```

## Transactions & RLS

- `domain.TxManager` interface: `WithTargetAccount(ctx, accountID, env, fn)` and `WithTx(ctx, fn)`
- `WithTargetAccount` sets both `app.current_account_id` and `app.current_environment` via `set_config()` so every statement in `fn` runs under the tenant's RLS policy
- Repos extract tx from context via `conn(ctx, pool)` — falls back to pool if no tx
- Global queries (login, API key lookup, validate) skip tenant context — the `NULLIF(..., '') IS NULL` escape hatch in RLS policies allows NULL
- Background jobs run without environment context — the `IS NULL` branch processes all environments

**Critical RLS pattern** in migrations:
```sql
(NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_account_id', true), '') IS NULL
 OR account_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_account_id', true), '')::uuid)
AND
(NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_environment', true), '') IS NULL
 OR environment = current_setting('app.current_environment', true))
```

## Environment Isolation (test/live + custom)

- API keys carry an `environment` field (`live`, `test`, or a user-created slug)
- Auth middleware populates `AuthContext.Environment` from the API key; JWT callers opt in per request via the `X-Environment` header, defaulting to `live`
- All service methods pass `env` through to `WithTargetAccount` → RLS filters by environment automatically
- Licenses, machines, webhook endpoints, and webhook events have an `environment` column
- Products are environment-agnostic — they exist in every environment under the account
- Environments are first-class rows in the `environments` table, capped at 5 per account

## Pagination

All list endpoints use opaque cursor pagination via `core.Cursor` + `core.Page[T]`:

- Request: `?cursor=<opaque>&limit=<1..200>` (default 50)
- Response: `{"data": [...], "has_more": bool, "next_cursor": "opaque" | null}`
- Ordering: `(created_at DESC, id DESC)` — the `id DESC` tiebreaker is required because bulk-inserted rows share a `created_at` to the microsecond
- Handlers use the `cursorParams(c)` + `pageFromCursor[T](items, hasMore, getCursor)` helpers in `server/handler/helpers.go`

## RBAC

- `internal/rbac` owns flat permission constants (e.g. `rbac.LicenseCreate = "license:create"`) and a `Checker` bound to a role
- Four preset roles seeded in migration `016_memberships_and_roles.sql`:
  - `owner` — all permissions; only account owner can invite new owners / remove members
  - `admin` — full management minus account ownership transfers
  - `developer` — product, license, webhook, api-key CRUD
  - `operator` — license / machine lifecycle (suspend, revoke, activate, deactivate), no product or webhook write
- Handlers call `authz(c, rbac.Perm)` which returns the `AuthContext` after validating the caller's role has the permission
- Identity JWTs re-resolve membership+role from the DB every request (single JOIN via `GetByIDWithRole`); stolen JWTs can't forge elevated permissions
- L1 adds `policy:read` / `policy:write` / `policy:delete` on top of Release 1's preset bundles (owner/admin/developer get all three, operator gets read only). Seeded in migration `020_policies.sql`.
- L4 adds `customer:read` / `customer:write` / `customer:delete` with the same preset distribution. Seeded in migration `021_customers.sql`.

## Policies & Effective Values (L1)

Licenses own lifecycle configuration through a `policy_id` FK and a sparse `overrides` jsonb column. **Enforcement paths never read raw policy or override fields directly — always go through `policy.Resolve(policy, overrides)`**, which returns an `Effective` struct. This is the invariant that makes the cascade model work: a policy update rolls out instantly to every referencing license without copying values, and overrides layer on top per-license.

- **Overridable fields are quantitative only:** `MaxMachines`, `MaxSeats`, `CheckoutIntervalSec`, `MaxCheckoutDurationSec`. Nothing else.
- **Behavioral flags are policy-only:** `Floating`, `Strict`, `ExpirationStrategy`, `ExpirationBasis`, `RequireCheckout`. If you need different behavior, clone the policy and attach.
- **Expiration is a first-class column, not cascaded.** `licenses.expires_at` is materialized at creation (or first activation for `FROM_FIRST_ACTIVATION` policies) from `policy.duration_seconds`. Policy duration changes affect NEW licenses only. Vendors who want to extend existing licenses PATCH the license's `expires_at` directly. `LicenseOverrides` does NOT contain an expires_at field.
- **`POST /v1/licenses/:id/freeze`** snapshots the current `Effective` values into the license's `overrides` so future policy changes stop affecting that license. `AttachPolicy` moves the license to a different policy within the same product, optionally clearing overrides.
- **Expiration strategies on past `expires_at`:**
  - `REVOKE_ACCESS` (default) — background job transitions license to `expired`; validate returns `license_expired`; activate/checkin reject.
  - `RESTRICT_ACCESS` — license stays `active`; validate returns `license_expired`; activate/checkin reject. Client SDK decides what to do.
  - `MAINTAIN_ACCESS` — license stays `active`; validate returns valid. Pure informational expiration (useful for "perpetual with support expiry" model).
- **Default policy per product.** Every product auto-gets a `is_default=true` policy on creation (same tx as product insert). A partial unique index on `policies(product_id) WHERE is_default=true` enforces at most one default per product. Delete of the default is refused with `policy_is_default` (422) — promote another first via `POST /v1/policies/:id/set-default`. Delete of a policy in use is refused with `policy_in_use` (422) unless `?force=true`, which reassigns referencing licenses to the product's default inside the same tx.
- **Grants respect `AllowedPolicyIDs`.** When a grant's `GrantConstraints.AllowedPolicyIDs` is non-empty, grant-scoped license creation rejects any request whose effective policy ID (explicit or resolved default) is not a member, returning `grant_policy_not_allowed` (403).
- **Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-l1-policies-design.md`.
- **Implementation plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-l1-policies.md`.

## Customers (L4)

Every license references a first-class customer via `customer_id` FK. Customers are account-scoped (shared across environments) and have no login in v1 — the customer portal is explicit v2 (FEATURES.md §6).

- **Naming discipline:** the word `user` never appears in code referring to customers. `Identity` = logs in, `Customer` = license owner, `Membership` = join between identity and account. The word `reseller` also never appears — delegated creation is a **grant** from a **grantor account** to a **grantee account**.
- **Creation:** `POST /v1/licenses` accepts exactly one of `customer_id` (attach existing) or `customer: {email, name, metadata}` (inline upsert). Both provided → 422 `customer_ambiguous`. Neither provided → 422 `customer_required`. Email is normalized (trim + lowercase) and matched case-insensitively via the unique `customers(account_id, lower(email))` index.
- **First-write-wins for name/metadata.** License creation never mutates an existing customer's name or metadata. Use `PATCH /v1/customers/:id` to update those explicitly.
- **Grant-scoped creation** upserts into the grantor's tenant and writes `customers.created_by_account_id = acting account (grantee)`. Requires `CUSTOMER_CREATE` capability on the grant for inline customers; `CUSTOMER_READ` for attaching to an existing customer by id.
- **Grant-scoped visibility:** `GET /v1/grants/:id/customers` returns only customers where `created_by_account_id = acting account`. A grantee hitting `GET /v1/customers/:id` directly for a customer they did not create returns 404 (not 403 — no existence leak). The vendor's direct `GET /v1/customers` sees ALL customers in their account, with `created_by_account_id` populated to show attribution.
- **`GrantConstraints.CustomerEmailPattern`** (renamed from `LicenseeEmailPattern` in L4) is a Go RE2 regexp matched against the resolved customer email. The server wraps it as `(?i)^(?:<pattern>)$` for full-match case-insensitive semantics — unanchored patterns like `@acme\.com` cannot be bypassed by suffixes. Enforced in `licensing.Service.Create` after the customer is resolved, not in `grant.Service`.
- **Delete** is blocked with 409 `customer_in_use` when the customer has licenses (regardless of status — revoked licenses still pin the customer). Reassign licenses via `PATCH /v1/licenses/:id` body `{customer_id: ...}` first.
- **Tx discipline:** `customer.Service` is pure — no internal transactions. Handlers open `WithTargetAccount` and call service methods. This mirrors `policy.Service` and lets `licensing.Service.Create` call `customers.UpsertForLicense` inside its own tx without nesting.
- **Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-l4-customers-design.md`.
- **Implementation plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-l4-customers.md`.

## Domain Event Log & Webhook Dispatch (O2)

Every domain mutation records a `domain_event` with three-ID attribution via `audit.Writer.Record`, called synchronously in the service layer. The `domain.EventDispatcher` interface from Release 1 is retired.

- **Attribution:** `acting_account_id`, `identity_id`, `api_key_id`, `grant_id`, `actor_kind`, `actor_label` (denormalized at write time), `request_id`, `ip_address`.
- **HTTP surface:** `GET /v1/events` (cursor-paginated, filterable by resource_type, resource_id, event_type, identity_id, grant_id, from, to) + `GET /v1/events/:id`.
- **Webhook delivery** is now a background consumer: the 60s ticker in `background.go` polls `domain_events` via `ListSince` and fans out to matching webhook endpoints. In-process `Dispatch` is retired.
- **Event types:** license.created, license.suspended, license.revoked, license.reinstated, machine.activated, machine.deactivated, machine.checked_in.
- **Package:** `internal/audit/` — Writer + Attribution helper. `internal/db/domain_event_repo.go`.

## Webhook Delivery Log (O3)

Webhook deliveries are surfaced as a sub-resource under `/v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries`. Each `webhook_event` row now carries a `domain_event_id` FK, captured response body (truncated to 2 KiB), response headers, and `next_retry_at`.

- **HTTP surface:** `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` (cursor-paginated, filterable by `event_type`, `status`) + `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries/:delivery_id` + `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries/:delivery_id/redeliver`.
- **Redeliver:** loads the linked `domain_event`, creates a new `webhook_event` row, dispatches synchronously. Returns 422 `delivery_predates_event_log` if the original delivery has no `domain_event_id`.
- **RBAC:** `webhook:read` for list/get, `webhook:update` for redeliver (existing permissions, no new ones).
- **Migration:** `025_webhook_delivery_log.sql` — extends `webhook_events` with 5 columns + 1 index.

## Lease-Based Machine Liveness (L2)

L2 replaces heartbeat with cryptographically signed lease tokens. Every machine activation issues a `gl2` lease bound to the fingerprint and policy. Clients call `POST /v1/licenses/:id/machines/:fingerprint/checkin` to renew before the lease expires.

- **States:** `active` → `stale` → `dead`. The background `expire_leases` job (60s ticker in `internal/server/background.go`) sweeps via `policies.checkout_grace_sec`. Stale still counts toward `max_machines`; dead does not.
- **Resurrection:** re-activating a dead fingerprint reuses the existing machine row (same ID, audit history preserved). Status flips to active.
- **Lease token format:** `gl2.<base64-payload>.<base64-sig>` — sister to the existing `gl1.` license token. Same Ed25519 product key, same `internal/crypto/` signing pattern. NOT JWT — the spec says JWT but Release 1's actual format is custom; L2 follows Release 1.
- **Test vector** for SDK verifiers lives at `testdata/lease_token_vector.json` — deterministic Ed25519 seed + signed token + decoded payload. Regenerate with `go test -run TestGenerateLeaseTokenVector ./internal/crypto/`.
- **`require_checkout=false` policies:** every machine still gets a lease, but its expiry is bound to `license.expires_at` (or `9999-01-01` for perpetual). The background sweep filters by `require_checkout=true` so these machines never transition to stale/dead.
- **Heartbeat is fully gone:** no endpoint, no service method, no `last_seen_at` column. The `/v1/licenses/:id/heartbeat` endpoint returns 404.
- **`POST /v1/validate`** is unchanged — license-only validation, no lease issuance. Use activate/checkin for machine context.
- **Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-l2-checkout-design.md`.
- **Implementation plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-l2-checkout.md`.

## Entitlements (L3)

First-class entitlement registry with stable `code` values. Entitlements attach to policies (inherited by every license) and optionally per-license (add-only). Effective set = sorted union. Embedded in `gl2` lease tokens and returned in `POST /v1/validate` responses.

- **Code format:** `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{0,63}$`, unique per `(account_id, lower(code))`. Immutable after creation — to rename, delete + recreate. Callers use codes in public APIs, not IDs.
- **Three tables:** `entitlements` (registry), `policy_entitlements` (join, ON DELETE RESTRICT), `license_entitlements` (join, ON DELETE RESTRICT). All account-scoped, env-agnostic.
- **Attach semantics:** POST = idempotent add; PUT = replace entire set; DELETE /:code = single detach. Unknown codes → 422. Attach to policy requires `policy:write`; attach to license requires `license:update`; registry CRUD requires `entitlement:read/write/delete`.
- **Three-set response:** `GET /v1/licenses/:id/entitlements` returns `{policy: [...], license: [...], effective: [...]}`.
- **Lease token population:** `ResolveEffective` (one UNION SQL query) runs on every Activate and Checkin, populating `LeaseClaims.ent`. Newly-attached entitlements are visible at the next checkin.
- **Validate response:** `POST /v1/validate` returns `entitlements: [codes...]` alongside the license.
- **Grant enforcement:** `GrantConstraints.AllowedEntitlementCodes` checks every inline-attached code at license creation time. Rejection → 403 `grant_entitlement_not_allowed`.
- **Delete guard:** 409 `entitlement_in_use` if any policy or license references the entitlement (FK RESTRICT). Detach first.
- **Known limitation:** `require_checkout=false` machines hold long-lived leases. Newly-attached entitlements are not visible to those machines until their next checkin (which may be never). Document explicitly in API guides.
- **Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-l3-entitlements-design.md`.
- **Implementation plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-l3-entitlements.md`.

## Import Conventions

```go
import (
    "github.com/getlicense-io/getlicense-api/internal/core"     // IDs, enums, errors
    "github.com/getlicense-io/getlicense-api/internal/domain"   // models, repo interfaces
)
```

- `core.AccountID`, `core.NewAppError`, `core.LicenseStatusActive` — system language
- `domain.Account`, `domain.ProductRepository`, `domain.TxManager` — business contracts

## Environment Variables

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...              # required
GETLICENSE_MASTER_KEY=<64-hex-chars>     # required, min 64 chars (32 bytes)
GETLICENSE_HOST=0.0.0.0                  # default
GETLICENSE_PORT=3000                     # default
GETLICENSE_ENV=development               # optional — enables:
                                         #   - human-readable logs (vs JSON)
                                         #   - HTTP/localhost webhook URLs
```

## Crypto Key Derivation

All derived from `GETLICENSE_MASTER_KEY` via HKDF-SHA256 with fixed context strings:
- `"getlicense-hmac-key"` — API key, license key, refresh token hashing
- `"getlicense-encryption-key"` — product private key encryption at rest
- `"getlicense-jwt-signing-key"` — JWT access token signing

## DevSecOps

- **CI**: GitHub Actions on push/PR — `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, `go test -short`, `go build`
- **Pre-commit hook**: `make hooks` installs `gofmt` check + `go vet`
- **Linting**: `.golangci.yml` — errcheck, govet, staticcheck, unused, ineffassign, gosimple

## Auth — Dual-Mode

Single middleware detects by prefix:
- `gl_live_*` / `gl_test_*` → API key auth (HMAC lookup, account-wide)
- Otherwise → JWT auth (verify, extract user + role)

Use `core.APIKeyPrefixLive` and `core.APIKeyPrefixTest` — never hardcode prefix strings.

## CLI

```bash
getlicense-server              # start API server (default)
getlicense-server serve        # same as above
getlicense-server migrate      # run migrations and exit
```

## Gotchas & Debugging

- **Fiber v3 requestLogger status is unreliable on error paths.** `internal/server/app.go`'s `requestLogger` reads `c.Response().StatusCode()` BEFORE the ErrorHandler rewrites it with the final status from the returned `*core.AppError`. When a handler returns an error, server logs may show `status=200 latency_ms=1` while the client actually received 401/403/etc. with a populated error envelope. During debugging, trust the client-side `curl -w "HTTP=%{http_code}"` output or the response body (which contains the typed `error.code`), not the request log.
- **Never reuse bare-column `xColumns` constants inside JOIN queries.** The shared constants like `membershipColumns = "id, account_id, ..."` work fine for single-table SELECTs, but if you concatenate them into a JOIN against a table with overlapping column names (e.g. `roles` also has `id`/`account_id`/`created_at`/`updated_at`), Postgres emits `ERROR: column reference "id" is ambiguous (SQLSTATE 42702)`. Solution: spell out the columns inline with the table alias prefix in JOIN queries. See `MembershipRepo.GetByIDWithRole` for the pattern. Keep the shared constant for every other method that only hits the base table.
